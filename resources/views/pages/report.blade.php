	<p>All questions, feedback and bug reports are welcome. If you're having an issue, we usually need the following information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A brief description of the issue</li>
		<li>Link to any page where you saw the issue</li>
		<li>Screenshots that illustrate the problem (<a href='http://take-a-screenshot.com'>How do I take a screenshot?</a>)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Following these steps could greatly help me, and the community.</p>

	<p>
		If you'd like, please check that the issue doesn't already exist on the <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivcrafting'>Subreddit</a> or the <a href='https://github.com/Tickthokk/ffxivcrafting/issues'>Github issue tracker</a>.  Comment/add to those discussions if it already exists!
	</p>
	<p>
		Post the above information on the <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivcrafting'>Subreddit</a>, or <a href='mailto:tickthokk@gmail.com'>Email me</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the Subreddit could help others having the same issue and encourages them to give their input on it as well!
	</p>
	<p>
		You can either attach the screenshot to the email, or if you need to host it I highly recommend <a href='https://imgur.com'>Imgur</a>.
