		Control

	<p>
		Increases the amount of quality gained when using quality increasing actions. The higher quality is for a synthesis, the higher your odds of making a High-Quality version of the item is.

CP does not recover during synthesis unless a CP recovery skill was used. Allows use of special crafting skills. Skill effects include increasing durability of an item, increasing Control stat each time quality of an item is increased (to increase chance of HQ item), etc.
