<h1>Leve Breakdown</h1>

@include('leve._chart')

@if($leve->triple)
<p>
	Because this is a Triple Turnin, using three leve allowances will net you three turnins, as opposed to three allowances allowing only one turning with other leves.
</p>
@endif

<p>Most likely you will stop doing this leve after 5 levels, but depending on market prices/etc it may be benefitial to keep turning it in well past that.</p>

<p>Use your best judgement when deciding which level to mass produce.</p>
